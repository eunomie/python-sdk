# A descriptor has one shape for a git ref and for a workspace path: `ref` is
# the address, `pin` the refPin. There is no name to pin: the engine derives
# it from the module's own config, as it did for the schema this client was
# generated from, so the two agree unless the module renamed itself since,
# and then the client is stale and its first selection says so (see
# stale_client_error).
#
# Two queries serve a target, and one condition picks between them:
#
#   a local target, in a process a module entrypoint runs
#       node(id: <the source handed over for that client>) {
#         ... on ModuleSource { asModule { serve } } }
#
#   any other target
#       serveModule(address: <ref>, refPin: <pin>)
#
# serveModule resolves a git address itself, and a path in the caller's
# current workspace. That is the right workspace for a plain program. Under
# a Dang entrypoint it is not: the module's code runs in an exec the
# entrypoint starts, the engine gives that exec no module context, and the
# process is a plain nested client whose current workspace is the one the
# engine finds in its own container. The entrypoint asks the engine for the
# module's declared local clients and hands each over by name, as a source
# over that client's own files (entrypoint/handover.dang). No workspace
# reaches this process: in Dagger an ID is a capability, and this is
# third-party code. A git address depends on no workspace, so it keeps
# serveModule either way.
